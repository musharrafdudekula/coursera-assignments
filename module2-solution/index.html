					Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’ untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was severely wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had inserted a powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.

					<br><br>

					Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the magnet with the RT, a miniature version of a device originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor. Furthermore, he and Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with which to escape. The suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony enough time to power it up to fight their terrorist captors.

					<br><br>

					With help from his friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes, the inventor returned home and promptly announced Stark Industries departure from the weapons business. His personal assistant Pepper Potts backed the sudden course reversal, but his father’s old friend and business partner, Obadiah Stane, strongly disagreed with what he saw as a rash decision.

					<br><br>

					Stark worked overtime in his lab to streamline the armor, and when he’d finished, a new persona emerged: Iron&nbspMan. After he discovered Stane had illegally sold Stark weapons to the Ten Rings, he donned the armor to return to Afghanistan and stop the group from using them. Later, he also learned that Stane had paid the Ten Rings to kill him and had been working behind Stark’s back to steal the entire company. The older man then forcibly took the RT from Tony’s chest and left his old friend’s son to die. But, Potts helped Stark insert his original, cobbled-together RT into his chest, and Iron&nbspMan flew again.

					<br><br>

					Stane presented himself in a gigantic suit of armor of his own, and a battle ensued until Stark and Potts overloaded Stane’s power source and Stane died in the process. Feeling more confident in himself than ever before, Stark called a press conference soon after the fight and impulsively announced to the world that he was indeed Iron&nbspMan.

				<h2 class="steve">Captain America</h2>
				<p>
					Envious of his friend Bucky Barnes’ military enlistment, and undeterred by his own multiple rejections by the U.S. Army, physical weakling Steve Rogers made one more attempt to join the march of men to fight for their country in the dark days of World War II. Rogers’ valiant wish to fight bullies wherever they were grabbed the attention of scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine, and he handpicked the idealistic young man for the Army’s Super-Soldier program under his supervision.

					<br><br>

					Though Rogers learned of Erskine’s disastrous previous attempts to realize a super-soldier, Germany’s so-called “Red Skull,” he braved the process and emerged from it a new man. With a powerful body and heightened speed and reflexes, Rogers faced his first challenge when forced to chase down Dr. Erskine’s assassin immediately following the experiment. In doing so, he also learned of the involvement of Hydra, the Nazi science division, in the doctor’s murder.

					<br><br>

					The Army moved swiftly to create a colorful, star-spangled persona for Steve Rogers they called “Captain&nbspAmerica,” and put him on a tour to sell war bonds. Chafing at what he felt was inaction, Rogers jumped at the chance to join the real fighting when he received news of the capture of his friend Barnes’ army division and rushed to rescue the soldiers. Upon the successful completion of the unplanned mission—and a brief meeting with the Red Skull himself—Rogers determined his path as a one-man fighting force.

				<h2 class="odinson">Thor Odinson</h2>
				<p>
					Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people. Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless looked forward to the day of his ascension to the throne. But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of the Asgardians and Loki’s people, and Odin—hoping to teach his son humility—divested Thor of his magic hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.

					<br><br>

					Alone and unable to return to Asgard, Thor met scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig in the midst of their investigation into strange activity near a small New Mexico town. While his brother struggled with the limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to allow the Frost Giant king—his real father—into Asgard to slay Odin in his sleep. Back on Earth, Thor sacrificed himself to save the town from destruction and in doing so, impressed Odin enough to restore him to full Asgardian power.

					<br><br>

					With Mjolnir once again in his grasp and the admiration and possible love of Jane Foster, Thor returned to his home, routed the Frost Giants, and defeated Loki in battle. Chagrined at his loss and stinging from Odin’s condemnation, Loki chose to fall away from Asgard into a strange warp in space while Thor and their father looked on. Though happy to be back in Asgard, Thor’s thoughts were filled with adventure on Midgard with Jane Foster.
